# My-Editors

Hello, this is just a public repositor that I am creating for saving my editor's config file just in case in the future I want to have this in my other editors.

Feel free to use it.

# Sublime Text
The config file "Sublime.settings" is the Preference settings of the Sublime Text Editor.
